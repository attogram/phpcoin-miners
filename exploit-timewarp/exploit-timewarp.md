## 1. Timewarp Attack Miner (`utils/miner.timewarp.php`)

This miner is designed to test a "Timewarp" vulnerability.

### Technical Details

The `miner.timewarp.php` script demonstrates an attack where a miner can artificially inflate the `elapsed` time between blocks to manipulate the mining difficulty. The script operates as follows:

1.  It performs a normal mining process to find a block with a valid hash (where `hit` > `target`).
2.  Once a valid block is found, the script does **not** submit it immediately.
3.  Instead, it pauses for a configurable duration (the "wait time").
4.  After waiting, it sets the block's timestamp to a future value (the "slip time").
5.  Finally, it submits the block with the manipulated timestamp.

This artificially increases the `elapsed` time since the last block, which can lower the `target` difficulty for the next block, making it easier to mine. The logic is encapsulated in a self-contained `TimewarpMiner` class within the script itself.

### How to Use

Run the miner from the command line, providing the node URL, your address, and CPU usage. You can specify the exploit parameters using the `--wait-time` and `--slip-time` options.

**Usage:**
```bash
php utils/miner.timewarp.php <node> <address> <cpu> [options]
```

**Example:**
```bash
php utils/miner.timewarp.php http://127.0.0.1 Pfoo1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 50 --wait-time=20 --slip-time=29
```

**Options:**
-   `--wait-time=<sec>`: The number of seconds to wait after finding a block before submitting. Default: 20.
-   `--slip-time=<sec>`: The number of seconds to push the block's timestamp into the future. Default: 20 (Max: 30).

### Recommended Defense

A robust defense against the Timewarp attack requires a multi-layered approach to ensure network-wide time synchronization.

1.  **Implement Median Time Past (MTP):** This is the primary defense. A new block should only be accepted if its timestamp is greater than the median timestamp of the last 11 blocks. This prevents any single miner from manipulating the timestamp significantly.
2.  **Use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) Client:** Each node should periodically synchronize its system clock with a trusted NTP server. This prevents the node's local clock from drifting significantly, which is a prerequisite for some time-based attacks.
3.  **Implement Peer-to-Peer Time Checks:** Nodes should query each other for the time and refuse to connect to peers whose clocks are too far out of sync with their own. This helps to isolate nodes with incorrect time and maintain a consistent network time.
